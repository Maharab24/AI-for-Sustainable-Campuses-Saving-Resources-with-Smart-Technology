# AI for Sustainable Campuses

##  Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance sustainability in university campuses by optimizing energy, water, waste, and transportation systems. By leveraging AI-driven models and real-time data, the proposed framework aims to transform traditional campus management into smart, green, and efficient ecosystems.

---

##  Objectives

- Develop a modular AI framework for optimizing sustainability resources (energy, water, waste, transport) in campuses.
- Enable real-time monitoring and predictive analytics for intelligent decision-making.
- Offer dashboards and visual tools for administrators and stakeholders.
- Establish campuses as testbeds for scalable AI-driven sustainability solutions.
- Align with United Nations SDGs, particularly:
  - **SDG 7**: Affordable and Clean Energy
  - **SDG 12**: Responsible Consumption and Production

## Methodology

###  System Architecture

The system is built in **three phases**:

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Sensors: Energy meters, occupancy detectors, water flow sensors, etc.  
   - Historical Data: Utility bills, weather, usage logs  
   - APIs: Weather forecasts, traffic data

2. **Model Development**
   - **Energy**: LSTM, XGBoost, Isolation Forest, DDPG, Q-learning
   - **Water**: Autoencoders, One-Class SVM, Decision Trees, LSTM, K-Means
   - **Waste**: CNN, Linear Regression, Genetic Algorithms, Dijkstra
   - **Transport**: ARIMA, LSTM, A*, Reinforcement Learning, Logistic Regression

3. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Edge computing for fast decisions
   - Web-based dashboards
   - Modular architecture for scalability

##  Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: GDPR-compliant anonymization
- **Bias Prevention**: Fair training datasets for accurate predictions
- **Transparency**: Explainable AI models for stakeholder trust

---

##  Case Study

- **Test Campus**: Simulated medium-sized university
- **Population**: 12,000
- **Buildings**: 20
- **Transport**: Shuttle + basic EV support
- **Results**: Validated system feasibility with real-world data simulations

## Limitations

- Testing done in simulated environments, not live campuses
- Sensor data quality affects prediction accuracy
- Real-time deep learning on edge devices requires optimization
- Must address privacy and data governance rigorously
